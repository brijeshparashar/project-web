# The Project Tacking React App.

## Running the application

* Before running the application please ensure that the service is up and running else the page will show error message. Link for the service project is: https://github.com/brijeshparashar/project_services
* Once the backend service is up then run the following commands to bring the UI application up.\n
    "npm install" \n
    "npm start"  \n
* The application will automatically open in the browser running on default port 3000. The defaul URL will be http://localhost:3000
* The page will appear on screen. And now the user can play around with the application. 
* It will show two accordions for checkpoints as currently the DB is loaded with one Project with ProjectId - 1 and two checkpoints. 
* By Default the backend services would be running on port 8080 so the UI application will connect to backend without any change. 
* For some reason if the backend service is started on a different port (say 8081) then change that port into the ProjectApp.tsx file in the serviceURL.
